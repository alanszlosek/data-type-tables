Inserts of all fields will be quite expensive: multiple indices to update, across several tables.

Best for apps with few data modifications compared to reads, since inserts might cover 4 tables, where each requires an index update.

Also, best for apps with minimal searching. Joins are fine, but searching, ugh.
